# Text Extractor OCR

Text Extractor OCR is a web-based application that allows you to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This project utilizes the Tesseract.js library to process images and extract the text content in a fast and efficient manner.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image from your local system to extract text.
- **OCR Processing**: Extract text from images using the Tesseract.js OCR engine.
- **Progress Tracking**: See real-time OCR progress during processing.
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- **Error Handling**: Displays a helpful message if no text is found or if an error occurs during extraction.
